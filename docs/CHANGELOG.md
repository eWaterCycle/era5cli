## Unreleased

## 1.4.2 - 2023-12-12

**Fixed:**

 - Fixed a typo in the error message when an invalid area was given ([#160](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/160)).
 - Fixed pressing Enter not working for the default input in the "*Valid CDS keys found in the .cdsapirc file. Do you want to use these for era5cli? [Y/n]*" prompt ([#160](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/160)).

**Added:**
 
 - era5cli is now available for Python 3.11 ([#160](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/160)).

**Removed:**

- Support for Python 3.7 has been removed. It's [end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#unsupported-versions) was 2023-06-27 ([#160](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/160)).


## 1.4.1 - 2023-06-30
**Fixed:**

 - Fix a bug that prevented the creation of the configuration file, if the "~/.config" folder did not exist yet ([#154](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/154)).

**Added:**

- The developer documentation now contains instructions on how to maintain the conda-forge feedstock for era5cli ([#150](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/154)).

**Changed:**
 
 - Before asking for a user input, a check is made if the code is running in an interactive terminal or not. If not (e.g. if era5cli is called through a different script and stdin is not available), the input request is skipped ([#152](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/154)).

**Dev changes:**

 - A pre-commit hook has been added, to facilitate pre-commit users. Documentation on the setup is added to the developer documentation ([#153](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/154)). 


## 1.4.0 - 2023-04-21
**Added:**

 - Add validator for user's CDS keys. This should provide better feedback to users and reduce user error ([#138](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/138)).
 - Added `--splitmonths` argument for `era5cli hourly`. This allows users to avoid a Request Too Large error ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).
 - When a request would encounter a Request Too Large error in the CDS API, they are warned, and given a suggestion to use the new `--splitmonths` argument ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).
 - Added -`-dashed-varname` argument, to produce file names where the variable name is separated using dashes. For example: `soil-type` vs. `soil_type`. For the ongoing discussion, see [#53](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/issues/53).

**Changed:**

 - Change CDS keys from cdsapi default `.cdsapirc` file to `.config/era5cli/cds_key.txt` file ([#138](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/138)).
   - This will avoid conflict with e.g. ADS keys
   - The user can configure the keys using `era5cli config`, no need to create a file in the right location.
 - When a request would encounter a Request Too Large error in the CDS API, they are warned, and given a suggestion to use `--splitmonths` ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).
 - If a user makes a request without `--splitmonths` they are warned that the behavior will change in the future, and that they have to choose between `--splitmonths False` and `--splitmonths True`
 - When a file already exists and would be overwritten, the user is prompted for confirmation. This should prevent accidental overwriting of files. This check can be skipped with the `--overwrite` flag ([#143](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/143)).
 - The earliest valid start year of ERA5 requests has been updated to 1940 (for ERA5-land it is still 1950) ([#146](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/146)).
 - Usage of `--prelimbe` now raises a deprecation warning. It will be deprecated in a future release, as all the back extension years are now included in the main products ([#147](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/147)).
 - The documentation has been fully overhauled, and now uses Markdown files & MkDocs ([#142](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/142), [#144](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/144)).

**Dev changes:**

 - `cli.py` has been refactored to make the structure more clear. Seperate argument builders are now in their own modules ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).
