For ease of searching, an overview of all available variables is shown below. These can also be displayed using the `name` argument, for more information look [here](../formulating_requests.md#using-the-info-command).

???+ tip
    With the built-in `grep` command, you can also search through the lists of different variables in era5cli, for example:

    ```
    era5cli info "2Dvars" | grep temperature
    ```

    will list all single level variables that contain the word 'temperature'.

### Lists of variables

Note: the variable lists will be added by the gen_references_pages.py script to the bottom of this file
