## Copernicus CDS credentials

To be able to use era5cli, you need to be [**registered**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register?destination=%2F%23!%2Fhome) at the Copernicus Climate Data Service (CDS).

After activating your account, **login** on the CDS website, go to your **profile page** (top right on the website), and view your **API keys** at the bottom of the page.

To configure era5cli to use these keys, open up the environment you installed era5cli in, and do:

```sh
era5cli config --uid ID_NUMBER --key "KEY"
```

*Where ID_NUMBER is your user ID (e.g. 123456) and "KEY" is your API key, inside double quotes (e.g. "4s215sgs-2dfa-6h34-62h2-1615ad163414").*

After running this command your ID and key are validated and stored inside your home folder, under `.config/era5cli/cds_key.txt`.

!!! note
    If you already have a `.cdsapirc` file for the CDS api (or older version of era5cli), you will be asked if you want to copy these keys upon making an `era5cli` request.

## Your first request

Now you should be able to make a request for data from the CDS. For example:

```sh
era5cli monthly --variables soil_type --startyear 2000 --months 01
```

Which will download the monthly mean `soil_type` data, for January 2000.
