# General development

## Installation

For a full development enviroment run the commands below.

!!! note
    This is optional: if you already have [`hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/) in your main environment, this setup is not needed, as you can use the `hatch` environments to run all commands.

=== "Unix"
    ```sh
    # Create a virtual environment, e.g. with
    python3 -m venv env_name

    # activate virtual environment
    source env_name/bin/activate

    # make sure to have a recent version of pip and hatch
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip hatch

    # (from the project root directory:)
    # install era5cli as an editable package, along with the dev dependencies
    python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .[dev]
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```sh
    # Create a virtual environment, e.g. with
    python -m venv env_name

    # activate virtual environment
    env_name/Scripts/Activate.ps1

    # make sure to have a recent version of pip and hatch
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip hatch

    # (from the project root directory:)
    # install era5cli as an editable package, along with the dev dependencies
    pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .[dev]
    ```

## Testing commands

As the project is set up with `hatch`, you can test changes made to the code by running, for example:

```sh
hatch run era5cli info 2Dvars
```

This will run the *local* era5cli code in a virtual environment.

## Running unit tests

era5cli uses `pytest` for unit testing. Running tests has been configured using `hatch`, and can be started by running:

```sh
hatch run test
```

In addition to just running the tests to see if they pass, they can be used for coverage statistics, i.e. to determine how much of the packageâ€™s code is actually executed during tests. Inside the package directory, run:

```sh
hatch run coverage
```

This runs tests and prints the results to the command line, as well as storing the result in a `coverage.xml` file (for analysis by, e.g. CodeCov or SonarCloud).

## Running formatters and linters
For linting and code style we use `flake8`, `black` and `isort`. All tools can simply be run by doing:

```sh
hatch run lint
```

To easily comply with `black` and `isort`, you can also run:

```sh
hatch run format
```

This will apply the `black` and `isort` formatting, and then check the code style.

## Generating the documentation

To view the documentation locally, simply run the following command:

```sh
hatch run docs:serve
```

The docs can also be built using `hatch run docs:build`.

## Versioning

Bumping the version across all files is done with bumpversion, e.g.

```sh
bumpversion major
bumpversion minor
bumpversion patch
```

## Making a release

This section describes how to make a release in 3 parts: preparation, release and validation.

### Preparation
1. Update the `docs/CHANGELOG.md` file.
2. Verify that the information in CITATION.cff is correct.
3. Make sure the version has been updated.
4. Run the unit tests with `hatch run test`.

### Making the GitHub release
Make a release and tag on GitHub.com. This will:

 - trigger Zenodo into making a snapshot of your repository and sticking a DOI on it.
 - start a GitHub action that builds and uploads the new version to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/era5cli/).
    - Which should trigger [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/era5cli-feedstock) to update the package as well.

### Validation
After making the release, you should check that:

1. The [Zenodo page](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3252665) is updated
2. The publishing action ran successfully, and that `pip install era5cli` installs the new version.
3. The [conda-forge package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/era5cli) is updated, and can be installed using conda.
